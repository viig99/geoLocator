My first pet project to get a fully functional social geoLocation based app. I am currently using the haversine function to calculate the distances between two points.
Soon Plan to shift it to Vincenty's formulae for greater accuracy.

>TODO
Implement Location Saving to file/database.
Finding Mean distances with friends location(a weighted mean).
Plotting the Locations with google API.
Social Locaters with facebook integeration.
